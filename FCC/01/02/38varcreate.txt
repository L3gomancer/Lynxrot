// To create a CSS Variable you declare it with a name and assign it a value
--penguin-skin: gray;
Now you can use (call? ref?) that variable elsewhere in your CSS to change the value of other elements to gray.

Can this be declared in its own CSS rule? Or only within an existing rule? involving any type of selector?
Can they be chained?
